This is a UART softcore.

For now, I only have implemented UART transmitter without FIFO

Instruction to use this softcore:
1. Modify 'i_data' to whatever data you want to send
2. Modify baud_generator.v and enable_generator.v such that your system clock will divide nicely into your desired baudrate and a 500ms repetitive timer for 'start' transmission trigger
3. Feed in your data, system clock and start signals
