This is a UART softcore.

For now, I only have implemented UART transmitter without FIFO

Instruction to use this softcore:
1. Modify baud_generator.v such that your system clock will divide nicely into your desired baudrate
2. Modify 'i_data' to whatever data you want to send
3. When o_busy signal is LOW, feed in 'i_data', system 'clock' and 'i_start' signals
